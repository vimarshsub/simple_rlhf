"How do I check the IP address of my Linux machine?","You can use the `ip addr show` or `ifconfig` command in the terminal. `ip addr show` is the more modern command.","Just type `ipconfig` in the terminal."
"My Wi-Fi is connected but I have no internet access. What should I do first?","First, try restarting your router and modem. Wait for a minute after unplugging them before plugging them back in. This often resolves temporary connectivity issues.","You should immediately call your internet service provider."
"What is the difference between TCP and UDP?","TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that guarantees reliable, ordered delivery of data. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that is faster but doesn't guarantee delivery or order.","They are basically the same, just different names for internet protocols."
"How can I test the network latency to google.com?","Use the `ping google.com` command in your terminal or command prompt. It will show the round-trip time for packets sent to the server.","You need to download a special network testing software."
"Explain the concept of a subnet mask.","A subnet mask is used to divide an IP address into two parts: the network address and the host address. It helps devices determine if another IP address is on the same local network or a different network.","It's a security feature to hide your IP address."
"What does DNS stand for and what does it do?","DNS stands for Domain Name System. It translates human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 172.217.160.142).","DNS is a type of computer virus."
"My computer can't get an IP address from the DHCP server. What could be the problem?","Possible issues include: the DHCP server is down or misconfigured, there are no available IP addresses in the pool, or there's a network connectivity issue between your computer and the server. Check the server status and network cables first.","Your computer's network card is definitely broken."
"How do I flush the DNS cache on Windows?","Open Command Prompt as administrator and type `ipconfig /flushdns`, then press Enter. This will clear the local DNS cache.","You need to reinstall Windows to clear the DNS cache."
"What is the purpose of a default gateway?","The default gateway is the router on a local network that devices send traffic to when the destination IP address is on a different network. It acts as the exit point from the local network.","It's the main computer that controls all other computers on the network."
"How do I find the MAC address of my network adapter on macOS?","Go to System Preferences > Network, select your active network connection (like Wi-Fi or Ethernet), click 'Advanced...', and then go to the 'Hardware' tab. The MAC address is listed there.","You have to open the computer case to find the MAC address."
"What is NAT?","NAT stands for Network Address Translation. It's a method used by routers to allow multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address when accessing the internet.","NAT is a way to make your internet connection faster."
"I'm experiencing high packet loss when pinging a server. What does this mean?","High packet loss means that a significant percentage of the data packets being sent are not reaching the destination or returning. This usually indicates network congestion, faulty hardware (like cables or routers), or issues with the server itself.","It means the server is offline."
"What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?","HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses encryption (SSL/TLS) to protect the data transmitted between your browser and the website, ensuring privacy and integrity. HTTP sends data in plain text.","HTTPS is just a newer version of HTTP, they do the same thing."
"How can I check which ports are open on my local machine?","On Linux/macOS, you can use `netstat -tulnp` or `ss -tulnp`. On Windows, you can use `netstat -ano`. These commands list listening ports and the processes using them.","You need to run a port scanner from another computer."
"Explain VLANs.","VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) allow you to segment a physical network into multiple logical networks. Devices within the same VLAN can communicate as if they were on the same physical segment, even if they are geographically separated. This improves security and network management.","VLANs are used to connect different buildings together wirelessly."
"What is the function of ARP?","ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map an IP address to a physical MAC address on a local network. When a device needs to send data to an IP address on the same network, it uses ARP to find the corresponding MAC address.","ARP is a protocol for transferring files."
"My internet speed is much slower than advertised. What steps can I take to troubleshoot?","1. Restart your modem and router. 2. Test the speed with a wired connection directly to the modem. 3. Check for background applications consuming bandwidth. 4. Test at different times of the day. 5. Ensure your router firmware is updated. 6. Contact your ISP if the issue persists.","You should immediately buy a new router."
"What is a firewall and why is it important?","A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet), preventing unauthorized access and cyberattacks.","A firewall is software that speeds up your internet connection."
"How do I configure a static IP address on Ubuntu?","You can edit the Netplan configuration file (usually in `/etc/netplan/`). Define the interface, set `dhcp4: no`, and specify the `addresses`, `gateway4`, and `nameservers`. Then run `sudo netplan apply`.","Ubuntu automatically assigns static IPs, you don't need to do anything."
"What is the OSI model?","The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer serves a specific function in the process of network communication, from the physical connection to the application interface.","The OSI model is a type of network cable."
"Describe the difference between a hub, a switch, and a router.","A hub broadcasts data to all connected devices. A switch intelligently forwards data only to the intended recipient based on MAC addresses. A router connects different networks together and forwards data between them based on IP addresses.","Hubs, switches, and routers are all the same device with different names."
"What is VPN tunneling?","VPN tunneling is the process of encapsulating network data packets within other packets to create a secure, encrypted connection (the tunnel) over a public network like the internet. This protects the data from being intercepted.","VPN tunneling makes your public Wi-Fi connection faster."
"How can I check if a specific port is blocked by my firewall?","You can use tools like `telnet` or `nmap` from another machine to try connecting to the specific port on your machine's IP address. If the connection times out or is refused, the port might be blocked by the firewall. You should also check the firewall configuration rules.","If you can access websites, no ports are blocked."
"What is the role of ICMP?","ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used by network devices to send error messages and operational information. For example, the `ping` command uses ICMP echo requests and replies to test connectivity and latency.","ICMP is used for streaming video."
