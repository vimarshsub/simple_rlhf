"Explain how to make a simple HTTP server in Python","Here's how to create a simple HTTP server in Python using the built-in http.server module:

1. Import the module:
import http.server
import socketserver

2. Set the port number:
PORT = 8000

3. Create the server:
Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler)

4. Start the server:
print(f'Serving at port {PORT}')
httpd.serve_forever()

This will serve files from the current directory. You can access it at http://localhost:8000",5
"Explain how to make a simple HTTP server in Python","To make a server in Python, you can use http.server. Just import it and run it. It's pretty easy.",3
"Write a function to calculate fibonacci numbers","Here's an efficient implementation of the Fibonacci function using dynamic programming:

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize array to store computed values
    fib = [0] * (n + 1)
    fib[1] = 1
    
    # Compute values
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]
    
    return fib[n]

This implementation:
- Uses O(n) time complexity
- Uses O(n) space complexity
- Avoids redundant calculations
- Handles edge cases properly",5
"Write a function to calculate fibonacci numbers","def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

This is a simple recursive implementation.",2
"Explain the concept of dependency injection","Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that implements Inversion of Control (IoC) for resolving dependencies. Here's a comprehensive explanation:

1. Core Concept:
- Instead of creating dependencies inside a class, they are provided from outside
- This makes the code more modular, testable, and maintainable

2. Benefits:
- Loose coupling between components
- Easier testing through mock objects
- More flexible and maintainable code
- Better separation of concerns

3. Common Implementation:
- Constructor injection
- Setter injection
- Interface injection

4. Example in Python:
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, user_repository):
        self.user_repository = user_repository  # Dependency injected

    def get_user(self, user_id):
        return self.user_repository.find(user_id)",5
"Explain the concept of dependency injection","Dependency injection is when you pass objects to a class instead of creating them inside. It's useful for testing.",3
